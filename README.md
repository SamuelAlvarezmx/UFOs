# UFOs

## Overview

Use javascript to create a Dynamic webpage based on data of different UFO events. A dynamic page accepts user inputs and adjusts itself accordingly to what the user is changing in the page.

What was intend to create was a webpage based on UFO sightings, create a table with data about these sightings and let the user filter this table with the information of the table: 
  
    * Date
    * City
    * State
    * Shape

To create this page we used the following tools:
1. html: to give structure to the webpage.
2. javascript: to create the tables, listen to the events in the filters and read the UFOs data.
3. bootstrap: to customize the webpage.

## Results

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

* One of the most important drawbacks I see in this design is that is not very responsive to give feedback to the user. Meaning that maybe I am typing city wrong and it won´t let me know. Or if there is no data it won´t tell if there is any data, so it can be that the city was written wrong or is no data available.

A couple recommendations that may be helpful to keep developing this webpage to its full potential

1. Make the filter search more dynamic. Maybe adding a dropdown to some of the filter search options or even making a box choice option on how we want to filter the data.

2. Create a link in each of the UFO events that let us see an image or the complete story of what happened in that particular event, with this we are making more interactive and more visual each of the events presented in our table.
