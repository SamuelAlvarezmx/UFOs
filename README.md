# UFOs

## Overview

Use javascript to create a Dynamic webpage based on data of different UFO events. A dynamic page accepts user inputs and adjusts itself accordingly to what the user is changing in the page.

What was intend to create was a webpage based on UFO sightings, create a table with data about these sightings and let the user filter this table with the information of the table: 
  
    * Date
    * City
    * State
    * Shape

To create this page we used the following tools:
1. html: to give structure to the webpage.
2. javascript: to create the tables, listen to the events in the filters and read the UFOs data.
3. bootstrap: to customize the webpage.

## Results

Here are the instructions on how to use the webpage:

**1. The welcoming page looks similar to this image.**

**2. The layout of the page is a refresh link, several paragraphs that explain the main purpose of this page, a filter searc area which receives the input data to filter and finally the table with the information on the UFOs events registered.**

**3. The page when first loaded or when the UFO Sightings Title is clicked in will show the whole data registered**

**4. To filter the table by any of the filters or by all of them it is necessary to input the information of Date, City, State or Shape. It will then the page return the UFO sightings that meet the criteria of the search.**

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

* One of the most important drawbacks I see in this design is that is not very responsive to give feedback to the user. Meaning that maybe I am typing city wrong and it won´t let me know. Or if there is no data it won´t tell if there is any data, so it can be that the city was written wrong or is no data available.

* A couple recommendations that may be helpful to keep developing this webpage to its full potential

  1. Make the filter search more dynamic. Maybe adding a dropdown to some of the filter search options or even making a box choice option on how we want to       filter the data.

  2. Create a link in each of the UFO events that let us see an image or the complete story of what happened in that particular event, with this we are   making more interactive and more visual each of the events presented in our table.
